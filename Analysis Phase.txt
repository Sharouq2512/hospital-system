Analysis Phase in Software Development (Hospital Management System)
1. Definition of the Analysis Phase and Its Importance

The Analysis Phase is the second major stage in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project team studies the system requirements in depth to understand what the system must do. For a Hospital Management System, this phase identifies the needs of doctors, nurses, patients, administrators, laboratory staff, pharmacists, and other hospital departments.

The importance of the Analysis Phase includes:

Ensures accurate understanding of business and medical workflow.

Prevents misunderstandings and costly rework later.

Establishes a clear foundation for system design and implementation.

Aligns system features with real hospital operations and regulations (e.g., patient safety, privacy, medical record standards).

Helps stakeholders agree on the system scope and boundaries.

2. Sub-Steps of the Analysis Phase
a. Requirement Elicitation

The project team collects requirements from hospital stakeholders using:

Interviews with doctors, nurses, lab technicians, and administrators.

Observation of actual hospital processes.

Study of existing medical record systems.

Review of regulatory policies (HIPAA, GDPR, local health ministry rules).

Example Hospital Requirements Collected:

Patient registration and demographic management.

Appointment scheduling and ER check-in.

Doctor diagnosis and prescription entry.

Integration with laboratory and radiology systems.

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) storage.

Pharmacy inventory and dispensing.

Billing, insurance claims, and revenue cycle management.

b. Requirement Analysis and Classification

The collected requirements are organized into:

Functional Requirements (what the system must do):

A patient can be registered with a unique ID.

Doctors can record diagnosis and treatment plans.

Nurses can access patient medical history.

Billing system automatically calculates treatment costs.

Non-functional Requirements (system characteristics):

System must handle 500–5000 concurrent users.

Response time for medical record retrieval must be <3 seconds.

Compliance with medical privacy and data security standards.

c. Feasibility Study

Determines whether the hospital system is realistic and worth implementing:

Technical feasibility:
Hospital has network infrastructure, EMR hardware, and skilled IT staff.

Economic feasibility:
System reduces record loss, speeds service, and improves billing accuracy.

Operational feasibility:
Medical staff will accept the system due to improved workflow and data access.

Legal feasibility:
Must comply with medical data protection laws.

d. Creating System Models

Various diagrams and models are created to visually describe the system:

Use case diagrams:
e.g., Patient Registration, Appointment Booking, Generate Lab Report.

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):
Show how patient information flows between departments.

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD):
Define database entities such as Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Lab Report, Billing, etc.

Process workflows:
e.g., Emergency patient ➜ Triage ➜ Registration ➜ Nursing ➜ Doctor ➜ Discharge.

e. Requirement Validation

Confirms that requirements are complete, correct, realistic, and agreed upon.

Meetings held with hospital departments.

Cross-checks against policies and medical protocols.

Conflicting requirements resolved (e.g., doctors need speed vs. security).

3. Deliverables and Outcomes of the Analysis Phase
Major Deliverables

Outcomes

Clear understanding of system scope (what is included and excluded).

Alignment between medical users and the development team.

Reduced risk of project delays and requirement changes during development.

Strong foundation for the next SDLC phase (System Design).

4. Best Practices

Involve all medical departments early: Doctors, nurses, pharmacy, radiology, laboratory, etc.

Use real hospital workflow observations, not only interviews.

Document everything clearly using diagrams, tables, and structured requirements.

Prioritize requirements using techniques like MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won’t).

Validate requirements with stakeholders regularly to avoid misunderstandings.

Consider future scalability, such as multiple branches or telemedicine integration.

5. Common Challenges

Difficulties gathering accurate hospital requirements, as different departments may have conflicting needs.

Resistance to change from hospital staff used to manual systems.

Unclear legal or regulatory requirements, especially around patient data privacy.

Incomplete or changing requirements, especially in large hospitals with many services.

Limited IT knowledge among medical staff, leading to communication gaps.

Conclusion

The Analysis Phase is critical for the successful development of a Hospital Management System. Detailed requirement gathering, structured modeling, and validation ensure that the system supports medical workflows, complies with standards, and ultimately improves hospital efficiency, data accuracy, patient care, and operational performance.
